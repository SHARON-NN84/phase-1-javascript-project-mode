üí° My Project Description
This Health and Nutrition Tracker is a user-friendly application designed to help you monitor your daily health metrics and nutritional intake. It empowers you to take control of your well-being by providing a simple way to log what you eat, track your physical activity, and keep an eye on key health indicators.

What the website is for: A comprehensive tool for personal health and nutritional management.

Goal: To empower user to make informed decisions about their health by monitoring  progress over time.

Key Features:

Food Logging: Easily record your meals and snacks with details on portion sizes.

Nutrient Tracking: Get an estimated breakdown of calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates consumed.

Progress Visualization: View charts and summaries to understand your trends and progress.

Technologies Used:  Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging a JSON Server for mock API data.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the Tracker running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Git: For cloning the repository.

Node.js & npm (or Yarn): If your project uses JavaScript for the frontend and/or a development server.

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[MumbiShalonGitHubUsername]/health-nutrition-tracker.git
(Note: Replace [MumbiShalonGitHubUsername] with Mumbi Shalon's actual GitHub username, and health-nutrition-tracker with the exact repository name.)

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd health-nutrition-tracker
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
# or if you prefer yarn
# yarn install
Run the application:

If you have a development server configured (e.g., using create-react-app or a simple http-server):

Bash

npm start
If it's a static HTML/CSS/JS project, you might just open index.html in your browser, or use a Live Server extension in your code editor.

If you are using JSON Server as a mock backend:

Bash

npm install -g json-server # Install globally if you haven't
json-server --watch db.json # Assuming your data file is named db.json
(You might need two separate terminal tabs: one for your frontend dev server and one for JSON Server.)
